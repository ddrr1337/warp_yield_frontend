# Commands handled by node contract


When the node contract receives a message, this message will include a "header" (first uint8 decoded from message) with the command that the node contract needs to execute. This way, the contract can distinguish the type of message it receives and what it should do with it.


| COMMAND | ACTION |
|---------|--------|
| 0 | Incoming withdraw (withdraw USDC) |
| 1 | Incoming warp request from master |
| 2 | Assets Allocated => send resume operations to master |
