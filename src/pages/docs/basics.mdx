# Welcome to Warp Yield

Warp Yield is a fully decentralized protocol that allows users to maximize efficiency in their yield. Warp Yield is a vault for all users that shifts to where USDC's returns are the highest within the AAVE protocol.  

#### What Problem Does It Solve

Warp Yield eliminates the need for users to pay high fees when transferring their capital across blockchains in search of higher returns. Since all participants' capital is pooled together in a common fund, changing the fund's returns requires only one set of network fees to move the capital of all participants, saving thousands of users gas costs.  

#### Permissionless

Warp Yield is a fully permissionless protocol. Any participant can shift all vault capital to another blockchain to achieve better returns on AAVE. Naturally, this change is a critical move that will require specific conditions to be met. [Check out warp procedure.](/docs/masterContractRoles/warp-assets)

#### Vault max capital

At this moment, the protocol is configured to create vaults with a maximum capacity of 2M USDC. A higher amount could excessively affect the AAVE interest rates, making the warps ineffective. 
Once the cap is reached, Warp Yield will open another vault to allow other users to join as well.
