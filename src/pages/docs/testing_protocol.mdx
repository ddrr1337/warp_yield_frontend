# WARP YIELD IS IN TEST MODE!



##### DONT TRY TO DEPLOY ON MAINNET, PROTOCOL IS NOT AUDITED YET!!


For presentation and testing purposes, Warp Yield is deployed on EVM testnets.

<span className="text-lg font-bold">DO NOT!!</span> attempt to deploy this protocol on a mainnet without auditing it first!!




#### Location of the master node and the nodes in test mode.


```mermaid
graph TD;

A[Arbitrum Sepolia Master]
B[Optimistic Sepolia Node];
C[Base Sepolia Node];
D[Arbitrum Sepolia Node];


A --> B;
A --> C
A --> D


```

#### Important Notes on the Test Deployment.

Warp Yield is in test mode. This has important implications.

<strong>Warp Yield will not perform any checks to warp to another node.</strong>   
Warp Yield in test mode is deployed on 3 blockchains:

1. Aribitrum Sepolia
2. Optimistic Sepolia
3. Base Sepolia

Warp Yield can operate on any network that ChainLink CCIP supports. You can see the networks currently supported by ChainLink here. [View Blockains](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/supported-networks/v1_2_0/mainnet)

If you want to test your own Warp Yield vault, you have instructions of how to do this in the main [github repo](https://github.com/ddrr1337/warp_aave)
