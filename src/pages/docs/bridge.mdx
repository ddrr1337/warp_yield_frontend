# Bridge

Warp Yield provides a blockchain [bridge](/bridge) service to help users move their USDC between blockchains.

Warp Yield uses the official USDC Circle bridge under the hood to execute all transfers.
#### Brige fixed fees


This platform integrates an interface for using the Circle bridge, making the user experience more convenient.  
For this reason, Warp Yield charges a <strong>fixed fee of 1 USDC</strong> for each use of the bridge,no matter the ammount.  
This small commission helps maintain the web services and provides funds to pay the Warp Vault, ensuring that someone can execute a blockchain warp to improve the yield for everyone.

However, users are free to use the Circle Bridge instead on their own without paying this fee.
